His family left during the evacuation while he stayed behind to make some extra money, and perished here. He lived in a three-story dormitory near Polikhim, I don't remember the room.\n\nAnyway, he had a chain watch, a family heirloom. Bragged about it to everyone. Find that watch and bring it to me, I want to send it to his kid. I want the kid to have something to remember his old man by. The watch must be either in his room or in the tanker truck somewhere at the construction site. Arseny always kept the keys in his jacket. Anyway, do the job. So long!"

Customs has a big warehouse, the red one, near the garages. The package is located there on the second floor in the office. Grab it and stash it on Factory, in a metal shack on the second floor, near the dressing room area. Interested?"

Briefly - one of the foremen who worked on that fucking Polikhim has just in time laid his hands on some pretty important documents. You know, of course, how hard is everyone still gunning for any evidence on TerraGroup and its associates? Exactly. But the folks who tried to get the info out of that foreman happened to be more edgy than smart. The dude’s ticker stopped ticking before his tongue started wagging. Can you imagine? What dimwits! How do you do business with the likes of them? Okay, back to the point. So he grabbed the docs and stashed them somewhere. Asked around a bit, those who worked with him before. In general, chances don’t look too good, but who knows how lucky you can get? In a word, that foreman worked in the chemo shop. The shitmost shit, see. And somewhere on the Customs premises he and his homies had their bunkhouses. Eating there, chilling, most certainly inviting girl over, well, you get it. I figure it’s holed up there somewhere, most likely. If it’s not there, then we won’t find crap at all. So, I want you to search the shacks on Customs and bring me these documents. I think it's best to search for the locked ones."

I don’t think you will find much there if anything at all. Though he swore there’s something. Something else has surfaced: In the same dorm, he owned one more room, 203, but wasn’t babbling about it and, as a matter of fact, used it for storage. Now that’s where he had something of value for sure, more than one of his errand runners perished there. Also, he had a garage.

Do you know where the chemical factory is? Doesn’t matter now what was produced there and what is happening there now. I mean, who controls it or who tries to secure it. I have a firm suspicion that some sort of poison is leaking from the factory premises into the groundwater. And because of the lack of supplies from the outside, we are all forced to drink this water. Do you understand? Even the filters are no longer effective. If we do not resolve this issue, nobody would need ammo and grenades anymore. To figure it out I need the readings of radio and gas analyzers, which should be in the factory shops next to the water pumps.

Qualified engineers are already on it, but until then we will have to live on the remaining reserves, which are very scarce, indeed. However, to my knowledge, some people managed to make hay and stock up on clean water before the contamination. These people are part of the gang which inhabits the dorms next to the factory. Several people saw them carrying large plastic barrels full of clean water to that location. Though I can't blame them for surviving any way they can, we need that water more than they do. Besides, the contamination issue will be solved very soon, so they won't be needing that water anyway.

Well, he was a young specialist, still an intern, but very enthusiastic. Planned to enroll in the Military Medical Academy in St. Petersburg. And in his safe, right there in the room, he kept a case with the particular new medical device. Issued to him by the employer. He tried to get out of town on his blue VAZ 2109 with Saint Petersburg plates. I don't know if he managed to get out or not, but as far as I have heard, he either got stuck near the gas station or apprehended by the military.

All in rags, dirty head to toe, and the stench! A walking chemical weapon. Launched one on some vector, and where he goes, everything dies off. Hehe. Oh, damn, laughter through tears. But I digress. Just wanted to dispose of him, a bit farther away so the stink wouldn’t reach us, but one of our boys recognized his former homie in that pile of turd. Imagine that! Horrid things are going on, turning people from normal beings to such rubbish, and all for nothing! But that's not the point. The dude that recognized this heap of rags, said that he was not just a regular prick, but a Deputy Head of Security for two special sensitive zones on the Polikhim! Just imagine what kind of source could he become if he could at least remember his name, not just chew snots and mumble while slapping lips like a madman. What a shame! I don't know what got to him, but here's what I think. All this time that bagger lived somewhere, sleeping on some pissed-through mattresses, right? Right! You should look for that place. Need a hazmat suit? Haha, kidding. But if it comes to it, the hazmat’s on me, and not only it."

All these chemicals, valences, indecent bonds! Fuck that! Hehe. See, I even still remember some words. That was some teaching in schools back then! But whatever. It is necessary to confirm the experiment described there. And then this matter will shine upon us with new colors. This blue shit is abundantly scattered in barrels throughout the region, but nobody knows what it is. And nobody is too eager to figure that out either. But we will take our chance and find out. And make some profits with it. But this requires another stuff, It should be somewhere in the factory. There was a room filled with garbage - they had a laboratory there.

Don't know, intentionally or not, but if you believe the consignment notes from the same docs, the whole box of that stuff was already tried to be taken out from the factory. But this cargo was not logged on any of the checkpoints, so I figure it’s worth looking for somewhere in the warehouses on Customs. If they tried to transport it, then it's most likely still in the car, probably a van. And not just one lousy syringe, but a whole crate. Look out for some markings maybe, the crate has them. Got it? Ah, one more thing. My sweet friends Prapor and Therapist popped up, poking around. So come on, better not turncoat now. Just a bit more and we’ll be running this place. Good luck, bruv.

Now, they often make sacrifices to their gods, and what would you think they offer as sacrifice? Weapons. It is not clear where they take it from or what they do in the rest of their time. We only know that they have several such sacrificial altars everywhere. Find them and mark with beacons, and we will try to trace the activities of this organization in detail, to learn how much democracy they have."

You have already been by the caved tunnel on the Shoreline. TerraGroup attempted to move some cargo through it but failed, and now this cargo is temporarily stored somewhere, whereabouts unknown. Provisional headquarters for coordinating the company’s activities were moved to the resort when the conflict started, but, obviously, they are long gone now. However, I think it’s safe to assume that they couldn’t move out everything, and we can try to get some information there.

I’m aware that medical research was one of the top priorities for the company, and I'm almost sure that they had no time to evacuate its data and materials in time. Whatever they were doing, I think it can turn out to be very valuable, both for us and for medical science in general. It can earn us a ticket from Tarkov, even more than one. I’ve regularly met up with certain TerraGroup employees to discuss health care issues, so I'm pretty familiar with some of their works. One of my acquaintances, who, by the way, directly reported to that deceased Geländewagen management, used to live in the health resort building. Let me look it up... here it is, room 306.

No wonder, though, the documents that you’ve managed to find are dedicated to some serious research in the field of Immunology, and from what we can understand, they have made some significant progress in that direction. Judging by the signature on the documents, the research was supervised by the head of the Medical Service of the health resort. Quite an elderly person, I’ve met him a couple of times on Health Care Worker Day. Although he was a venerable scholar he preferred the repose of the countryside over the bustle of laboratories and often spent time in the Woods, driving around in a white minivan. Witnessing the success, I believe, could have motivated him to start experimenting on humans, the first one most likely being himself, according to medical tradition. Scientists are always like that.

I miss this opportunity now to sift through the Scopus database, I am pretty sure that it has the answers to my questions, emerged after that blood sample research. Where could one possibly find access to the web now, you ask? To address this issue, I was advised to contact the one going by the name of Mechanic. As it turned out, he has access to the Internet, and it’s even relatively fast. I’ve asked him to look up the necessary articles for me. He asked for a small fee for his services, in the form of gunpowder, for whatever reason. It looks like he’s supplying someone with ammunition or something like that, but I am not really interested in that. Most importantly, he will provide the information we need.

He painted different signs on the wall and on the floor, then walked into the middle of the circle these symbols formed, and started placing weapons there. To be honest, it didn’t even look strange, it made perfect sense to me. It’s natural for people to offer the most valuable things they have to their gods, and these days it’s weapons. Those are cultists, you might've already encountered them. I have enough power capacity for now. Look for some more graphics cards and coolers. And thanks for the package, by the way."

            "description": "Yesterday, someone was banging at the closed door in the kitchen. Sounds weird, right? I absolutely understand that this was impossible, but there was a sort of irrational fear inside me. Like when you're afraid of monsters under the bed as a child. I think such fears grow stronger the farther away you are from civilization. When you're among others, as part of the society, even if you find a monster under the bed, you can tell someone about it. But when you're alone in the dark every day, it doesn’t work that way. I’ll tell you what that \"monster\" was next time since the irregularities didn’t end with it. For example, someone’s jamming my signal, presumably from the Shoreline territory. It’s a hard trick to pull without powerful antennas. Try to look for satellite dishes, they most likely use something that looks similar. There should be at least two, about 400-450 meters away from each other."

That's how we create fears for ourselves. Interestingly, if I didn’t go and check what that was, it would be turned off in 15 minutes by the shutdown relay. After that, it would be extremely difficult to determine the source of the night sound. That’s how all those stories from newspapers are born, I assume. I can bypass the signal jammers by reconfiguring their frequency without raising suspicion of their owner as if things are still the same as they were. I need a few electronics for this and I think you can help me with this. The materials must be found silently so no one would get to know about what are we working on, only God knows, who might be involved in this. Here's the list of needed details, you probably know where to find them."

Teaching it to differentiate between faces and look for matches in the database didn’t take much time. Then I wondered, what if we ever create a mind, which will realize itself, what it will be like? In the last many years of civilization, humans kept becoming more humane. They started treating each other better, started caring for nature, animals. An opinion was formed that principles of human duty go side by side with highly developed civilization and reason. Then, shall it turn out that the mind of the computer, which of course will very quickly evolve into an over-mind due to its high learning capabilities, will also be most humane at the same time? Interesting, right? But we need to deal with these pests already. Install suppressors on the antennas you found, and, just in case, another one on the tower, also there on the Shoreline."

It's easy to be humane when nothing is threatening you. The answer to these questions was right before my eyes. The situation in Tarkov has shown us how much kinder we have become. Once the issues of survival came to the front, it turned out that decent people aren’t more common than maybe 500 years ago. There're probably even fewer of them now. What do you think, are you one of them? Okay, don’t overthink it. I need you to do something for me. However, you will need to remember quite a lot for this job.

Salvaging them all is impossible, but at least the cash can be taken. Should be especially plentiful in Goshan, and it's not that risky. Should be able to just grab the spoils and go, but there's one thing: they are all locked. So I have an offer for you about that: get me the key from the registers, and I’ll let you in on the cool schemes I’ve never shown to anybody. Brother to brother. Don't care where you get the key, you can just buy it from traders for all I care. But if you want an adventure, I know where the key could be. I knew one of the cashier clerks in Goshan, the guy wanted to leave the city on the bus during the conflict, and, well, got smoked at the gas station on Customs. Probably a good idea to check it out - what if he dropped the key somewhere on the seat? Well, go on, brother, don't let me down."

It seems his wish came true in Tarkov, the best and largest airsoft field in the world, with an only minor difference: here, you die and lose everything from a single stray bullet. Put together an AK-102, with a Ferfrans CRD Concussion Reduction Device, Magpul AFG OD tactical grip, Zenit Klesch-2U flashlight, RPK-16 buffer tube, and the Circle 10 magazine.

The value of art pieces by renowned artists grows every year. They are definitely talented, but the more you look at it, the more it seems that anything can be art. It can be a Rothko painting, a displaced urinal, or a bunch of garbage. However, in my opinion, the most amazing pieces of art are weapons, starting from the melee - which is already universally recognized as such and can be found in many museums - to an old AK or M4, which are beautiful as they are. But a weapon only transcends to true art when it becomes unique, one-of-a-kind, in the hands of someone who knows how to use it, who modifies it for his own needs, creating a masterpiece worthy of being displayed in the best of museums. Bring me one such masterpiece, an M4A1 with a KAC QDSS NT-4 (FDE) silencer, Alexander Arms MK10 rifle-length handguard, REAP-IR thermal scope, and a 60-round magazine. Ergonomics should be not less than 40, the recoil sum less than 270, and the weight of 5 kg or less."

People call him Killa, and his helmet... you won’t miss it. Get rid of him, everybody will say thank you. And take his helmet with you, just in case."

Check those catacombs out and let me know if it's worth sending a group there. The pay is good. You in?"

Long story short, my guys went there, and it turned out to be a real nasty place. Built with a high level of protection: filters, generators, all entrances are blocked by extremely strong hermetic locks, it's like an underground fortress. But the raiders opened the fucking thing and dug in like Alabama ticks. So, my men got in serious trouble, less than half made it out of there. But you know, now it's even more intriguing, for fuck's sake. So my people will not go there anymore for no reason, but if you could find a safe route for them... You are an experienced guy, so I need you to quietly, on those soft paws of yours, find out where all the entrances are. The guys said the entrances had those big hermetic doors. So it's up to you to scout the way in."

I've heard he's selling some secret stimulants, this means he understands chemistry quite well.

Anyway, I need it for different reasons: there's a gold mine of army supply crates next to it. I guess the owners didn't have time to load it all before leaving. I don't know who and why left that heli there, but my sources say that there's a craplot of valuable goods. Bring a signal marker and mark the bird, my people will deal with it after. The job is simple but important. Off you go then."

I'm sure that a specialist of such importance kept everything important on his person, so as not to risk the spread of information.\n\nYou need to thoroughly check the territory of the Laboratory, especially in the area of the block where the virus was developed. If my hunch is correct, you may find Vladimir's records there."

With enough ammo, they'll take me down if not on the first, then on the tenth attempt. However, I might have an idea where Skier is storing these rockets. Plenty of time's passed, they've already organized their firing positions, I'm sure of it.\n\nThey could be anywhere in the city, but in the forest we may be able to find all of their positions.

Although, I'd likely shock some of the folks from my class myself.\n\nRecently, a certain guy from my school days reached out to me. After school, he went into the army, wanting to join the special forces... It was clear even then that he had a peculiar, uh, aptitude for that job.\n\nSomehow he found me here and asked me for a favor. He wants to remember his early years in basic training. I'm not a big fan of that sort of hospitality, plus I've got heaps of work to do. But let me put it this way: he was, um, very insistent. I don't need any more trouble, so I agreed to his deal, hoping you'd help me sort it all out.\n\nPeople say this kind of equipment used to be somewhat standard issue at his job: ORSIS T-5000, Vityaz and a Glock 17. All with the special mods, of course.\n\nThe rifle was equipped with an ATACR 7-35x56 34mm scope, Harris bipod, and a suppressor, I can't recall which exact one... Well, probably doesn't matter. Just get any suitable silencer, that'll work.\n\nFor Vityaz I need the Micro T-1 red dot with a spacer, Zenit RK-6 front grip and RK-3 pistol grip, PT-3 Klassika buttstock... I also need a PEQ-15, Klesch-2P flashlight, and, as you probably guessed, a suppressor, the standard Vityaz one.\n\nThe Glock is simple. You need to replace the barrel with the Double Diamond with their thread protector, add a Pachmayr Grip Glove, Klesch-2P flashlight, and a 21-round extendo mag. I think that's everything."

For the greater good, naturally. Such a dangerous individual is not simple to track down, therefore we must understand his motives and goals, no matter how much they diverge from human values. \n\nWe were able to obtain a criminal case file from the local police department. According to this, the “butcher” worked as a driver for a meat packing plant here in the city limits. The bodies of the victims were found in refrigerator trucks used to transport frozen meat... But as the conflict escalated, the case was abandoned.\n\nNow, you have all the details. If you can find anything to help my colleague's research, he will hand you the keycards to that basement."

You seem to be interested in the development of our little venture, so I trust you'll be able to procure what we need. We need Zhuk armor and Vulkan helmet sets, shouldn't be too hard. \n\nOh, and also... Luka asked for something extra... He says he needs helmets like Killa's. To avoid the military, they need to take the base as quickly as possible. The crime world's known about Killa for a long time, even outside Tarkov. If we convince them that Killa and his gang are now operating even outside the cordon, they'll leave with their tails between their legs right away."

They won't be able to take the base by surprise. \n\nThat's why Luka asked to throw them some proper weapons to kill the cunts for sure. Everything they need is on the list right here. The cache must be real tough if those pricks aren't scared of even the military. Perhaps they got protection watching over them from the big land. \n\nBut that protection ain't gonna reach us.

If we don't want to lose our boys, we need to give them some medicine. \n\nLuka didn't ask for anything in particular, but it's in our interest to stock them well. So bring everything you've got.

However, nothing prevents them from forcing the locals into trucks and forcibly taking them to their territory. We must save the inhabitants from this fate.\n\nI have supplies of clothing and even spare rooms where I can temporarily house the newcomers.

He's obsessed with Russian firearms, and for several years now he's been working on his own project, called the AK-50. I don't think you've ever seen an AK that fires a .50 cal... The NATO one, I mean.\n\nSo the project is finally finished, and he sent me a test sample. Such a heavy and specialized rifle is too risky to be imported in one piece, so we broke the package into several parts. Well guess what, things in Tarkov didn't go according to plan. Shocker, I know.\n\nThe main body comes as one part, and it was seized in Atlantic waters. However I have the blueprint, so I need you to use it to build a new one for me. It certainly won't be easy in our circumstances. But at least you'll still have a copy of the blueprint for later use.\n\nThe handguard comes with the gas tube, and it was somehow intercepted by Skier's thugs. This part took two years to assemble, fit, and test, and the cost of development and prototypes has already gone over a couple million.\n\nThe dust cover was intercepted at one of the checkpoints already in Tarkov. I don't know which one, you'll have to search through all of them. But the barrel is definitely at the military base. Glukhar's personally organized an ambush on my convoy, and apparently knew about this shipment. You'll have to fight for it, or hope for some divine intervention.\n\nWhen you've collected all the parts, drop them off at the transmission tower shack near the gas station at the customs district. I'll ask my crew to deliver them from there, and after that I'll be able to manufacture the parts myself. And, of course, I won't forget your help."
